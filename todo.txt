* Platform code is now only in the top module, which will create circular dependencies
* Make sure it also works for automated tests
* Try to get rid of the top level platform projects
* Share configurations between projects
* Add Native platform
* Try without platform modules: should work for all except top one and ones that actually have platform-dependence

* Try :beta:js instead of :beta:beta-js (make sure to change the pattern in top level build.gradle)
* Try if platform modules can be skipped if they don't contain any code
